<h1>Whatâ€™s the purpose of the Standards Implementation and Testing (I&amp;T) Platform? </h1>
<br />
<p>The purpose of the Standards I&amp;T Platform is to direct developers of Health Information Technology to the appropriate resources to support their  efforts to implement health IT standards within their systems for certification of Electronic Health Record (EHR) technology, and in general, enable health information interoperability. The Standards I&amp;T Platform aims to provide a central collaboration place for developers and the standards community, and thus enable rapid use of those standards in EHRs. The platform consists of the following four key components: 
</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="knowledge_base.htm">A Knowledge Base</a></li>
  <li><a href="forum.htm">A Discussion Forum</a></li>
  <li><a href="issue_tracker.htm">An Issue Tracker</a></li>
  <li>A Sandbox (coming soon!)</li>
</ol>
Together, these components provide the Health IT community with a centralized set of resources to find answers to their implementation questions.  <a href="http://www.healthit.gov/" target="_new">ONC, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology</a>, facilitates and maintains the Standards I&amp;T Platform infrastructure. The content, guidance, and links are contributed and managed by members of the relevant standards organizations (e.g. <a href="http://www.hl7.org/" target="_new">Health Level Seven International (HL7)</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/" target="_new">Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>, <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/" target="_new">Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS)</a>, etc). In the event that the Standards I&T Platform does not contain the necessary level of information or detail a developer needs, they are encouraged to leverage additional support services offered by the relevant standards body.
<br /><br />
The initial configuration and workflow for the Standards I&T Platform was developed by the Standards I&T team leveraging a support workflow designed by the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/structure/index.cfm" target="_new">HL7 Structured Documents Workgroup</a>  Consolidated CDA Task Force to facilitate the flow of questions and answers between implementers and Standards Development Organizations (SDOs).  The workflow offers a unified, comprehensive and controlled mechanism to expedite implementer questions through the process of being answered by community subject matter experts, and evaluated and approved by the SDO.  It will be used as a foundation to support similar workflows for other community standards in the future.
